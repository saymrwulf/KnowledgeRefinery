Distributed Systems: Fundamental Concepts

A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system. The key challenges in distributed systems revolve around consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, as described by the CAP theorem.

CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer in 2000, states that a distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees:
- Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write
- Availability: Every request receives a response
- Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite network partitions

In practice, since network partitions are inevitable, the real choice is between consistency and availability during a partition event.

Consensus Algorithms

Achieving consensus among distributed nodes is fundamental. Key algorithms include:

Paxos: Developed by Leslie Lamport in 1989, Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus. It is known for being correct but difficult to implement and understand.

Raft: Developed by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout in 2014, Raft was designed to be more understandable than Paxos while providing the same guarantees. It uses leader election and log replication.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance: BFT protocols handle nodes that may behave arbitrarily (including maliciously). PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) requires 3f+1 nodes to tolerate f faulty nodes.

Eventual Consistency

Many large-scale systems adopt eventual consistency, where replicas will converge to the same state given enough time without new updates. Amazon's Dynamo paper (2007) popularized this approach. CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) provide a mathematical framework for eventual consistency without coordination.

Distributed Storage

Modern distributed storage systems include:
- Google File System (GFS) / HDFS: Designed for large sequential reads/writes
- Apache Cassandra: Wide-column store, designed for high availability
- CockroachDB: Distributed SQL, strongly consistent
- etcd: Distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes for configuration

Service Mesh and Microservices

Microservice architectures decompose applications into small, independently deployable services. A service mesh like Istio or Linkerd provides:
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Failure recovery
- Metrics and monitoring
- Mutual TLS authentication
- Traffic management

Clock Synchronization

In distributed systems, maintaining a consistent notion of time is challenging. Solutions include:
- NTP (Network Time Protocol): Best-effort synchronization
- Logical clocks (Lamport timestamps): Capture causal ordering
- Vector clocks: Track causality across multiple nodes
- Google TrueTime: Hardware-assisted time with bounded uncertainty
